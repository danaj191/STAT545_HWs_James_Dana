### Reflections on HW 3
Overall, this assignment went smoothly. I still can't figure out how to get the folder structure that I want on Git to separate the different files for each homework from each other, but that's OK. I also encountered some funny formatting issues, but once I messed around with everything for a while they eventually got sorted out. The one exception was formatting for tables, which I've called as a loss for now but would like to explore further soon.

### Reflections on HW 4
This assignment was fun because it was open-ended, but also challenging because of that. I had some troubles with spreading the data how I wanted for Prompt 1 Activity 2, and that actually took a but of time to mess around with. In the end, I did Giulio's suggested "trial and error" method, and finally got the result I wanted. I also had trouble formatting the table nicely with knitr; not sure what the calls are for making the table look extra pretty. For Prompt 2 Activity 1, I wanted to use the opportunity to mess around with Brazil's ag census data, which I will be using in my thesis. However, this wasn't a natural fit for this assignment, so I ended up choosing a weird measure to explore further, just to practice the arguments and familiarize myself more with Brazil's census database. So, not a very valid or interesting comparison I did, but a helpful exercise for me nonetheless.
