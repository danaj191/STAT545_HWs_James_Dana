### Reflections on HW 3
Overall, this assignment went smoothly. I still can't figure out how to get the folder structure that I want on Git to separate the different files for each homework from each other, but that's OK. I also encountered some funny formatting issues, including with tables, but once I messed around with everything for a while they eventually got sorted out.
